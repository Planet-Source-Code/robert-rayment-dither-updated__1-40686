Dither by Robert Rayment.  (Updated 26/11/02 Jump table used in ASM, 2-color saving corrected, improved scroll bars) This produces a 2-color bitmap from any original using a variety of methods and can be saved or printed.  The program can be run in VB or VB+ASM.  The structure of the asm file roughly follows that of the VB code and so should be useful for those new to assembler.  The asm code is in a bin file but could be stored in a res file or made into a dll or a class (see buggy). See Notes.txt for more info. Zip 58KB, Win98 & exe tested on WinXP.
